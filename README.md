# NAME

NAME is an experimental port of the livecoding music language [Tidalcycles](http://tidalcycles.org/) to the lua programming language. This project follows in the footsteps of [vortex](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vortex) and [strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org). For me the main purpose of this project is to learn about how to implement a livecoding language. It is not likely to be directly useful as a tool or instrument.

# Tranquility

Tranquility is an experimental port of the livecoding music language [Tidalcycles](http://tidalcycles.org/) to the lua programming language. 
This project follows in the footsteps of [vortex](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vortex) and [strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org). 
For me the main purpose of this project is to learn about how to implement a livecoding language.

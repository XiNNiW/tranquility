# Abstract

Tidalcycles is a popular language for improvising live-coded music. Tidalcycles allows artists to manipulate musical pattern using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) written in the Haskell programming language. 
Alex McLean, who is the primary author of Tidalcycles has recently begun several related projects that involve re-writing Tidalcycles from scratch as a form of design inquiry. 
In addition to a "clean-room" re-write of Tidalcycles in Haskell, McLean and the larger community have undertaken the project of translating Tidalcycles into other programming languages. 
Tidalcycles has so far been translated into Python, Javascript, and Kotlin. These projects, codenamed vortex, strudel, and kidal respectively, _______

This project aims to continue exploring the design space afforded by the process of translation/re-implimentation. 
Individually, I hope to learn about the constrution of livecoding languages by "hand-building" one - much as an apprentice luthier might build a guitar in order to learn how to build guitars. 
Additionally, I hope to begin answering some larger questions about livecoding languages as musical tools:
- To what extent can the pattern language of a livecoding language be seperated from its formal language? 
- What can we learn about the nature of the pattern language by attempting to seperate it from its host programming language?
- How to the affordances of a particular formal language affect the implementation and end user experience of a livecoding system?
- What new design possiblities does the process of translation reveal? How will they affect the development of Tidalcycles? How will they affect the development of new livecoding systems?
